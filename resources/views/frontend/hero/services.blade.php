  <h3 class="mt-3 mb-5"> Java</h3>
  <p> Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.
       It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world,
        by providing the reliable platform upon which many services and applications are built.
         New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java,
          as well. <br><br>There are many applications and even some websites that will not function unless you have Java installed.
           Java.com, this website, is intended for consumers who require Java for their desktop applications – specifically applications targeting Java 8.
            Developers as well as users that would like to learn Java programming should visit the dev.java website instead and business users should visit oracle.com/java for more information.</p>
<br> <h3 class="mt-3 mb-5"> Python</h3>
<p>Computer programming is important today because so much of our world is automated. 
Humans need to be able to control the interaction between people and machines.
 Since computers and machines are able to do things so efficiently and accurately,
  we use computer programming to harness that computing power.<br><br>
  This is the first of hopefully many programming courses that can introduce technically inclined people 
  to Python programming.</p>
  <br> <h3 class="mt-3 mb-5"> Big Data</h3>
<p>Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, 
    or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional
     data-processing application software. Data with many fields (columns) offer greater statistical power, 
     while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.
     Big data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, 
     search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[3] The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. Therefore, big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and value.</p>
<br> <h3 class="mt-3 mb-5"> C-programming</h3>
<p>C language Tutorial with programming approach for beginners and professionals,
     helps you to understand the C language tutorial easily. Our C tutorial explains each topic with programs.

     The C Language is developed by Dennis Ritchie for creating system applications that directly 
     interact with the hardware devices such as drivers, kernels, etc.

     C programming is considered as the base for other programming languages, 
     that is why it is known as mother language.</p>
