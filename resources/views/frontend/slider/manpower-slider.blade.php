  <h1 class="mt-3 mb-5"> Manpower</h1>
  <p> Manpower is the total number of people who can work to get something done. How quickly you 
      clean your house after a big party will depend on how much manpower you've got.
<br><br>
The term manpower can mean "labor force," "workforce," "workers," or simply "people,"
 and despite the man, it applies to both men and women. A large ship requires more manpower
  than a small sailboat, and the amount of manpower required to run Disneyland for a day is 
  estimated to be at least 20,000 employees, 
most of whom aren't wearing cartoon character costumes.
