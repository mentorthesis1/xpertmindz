  <h1 class="mt-3 mb-5"> Manpower</h1>
  <p> Manpower is the total number of people who can work to get something done. How quickly you 
      clean your house after a big party will depend on how much manpower you've got.
<br><br>
The term manpower can mean "labor force," "workforce," "workers," or simply "people,"
 and despite the man, it applies to both men and women. A large ship requires more manpower
  than a small sailboat, and the amount of manpower required to run Disneyland for a day is 
  estimated to be at least 20,000 employees, 
most of whom aren't wearing cartoon character costumes.<br><br>
<h2> Importance of Manpower</h2><br><br>
Manpower is one of the most critical assets in an organization. Without appropriate manpower, the work cannot happen. Imagine a factory with no manpower. The raw materials, inventory, finished goods nothing will move in the value chain. All these mission critical operations require skilled manpower.

If in an organization, the number of people available are more than the work it indicates that the organization has surplus workforce. In this type of organization, some people will remain with out work. This would be an additional cost to the organization, but sometimes organizations keep some extra employees with them just to use them when unexpected need arises. The manpower surplus maintained will be different in different industries.
<h2>Examples of Manpower</h2>
For example, in software service oriented companies, it is advisable to keep high number of employees in surplus. This is because the software service oriented companies get new projects at any point of time, and they must have sufficient manpower available to start working on that. The organization's capability to take up new projects will depend on its available employees. The clients would also look at the available skilled labor before allocating the project to a company. So the available workforce would play a key role in getting a new project from client.

In manufacturing companies and public sector companies, the surplus manpower would be minimum. And even though when they need additional employees they get them in the form of contract labors. This is because the labor laws do not allow the companies to remove the permanent workmen from the work easily when there is work and the management knows the demand for their product. And also, the demand does not fluctuate suddenly.
